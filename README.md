# Avant-Fintech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

### Avant, LLC 

* I have chosen [Avant, LLC](https://www.avant.com/about-us/)  which was founded in 2012 and is located in Chicago, IL (Headquarters) 

* Avant has three Co-Founders includes Al Goldstein (CEO), Paul Zhang, and John Sun. Of which, John is not linked anymore but Al and Paul are still involved with the company. 

* Once John Sun applied for a loan to found out the overly complicated process which led him to be frustrated. John thought that he wasted more time than what it should have taken him to apply for a loan. 

* John Sun teamed up with Paul Zhangs. Later their Y Combinator project raised the initial seed funding of $1 Million. Avant raised more than $1.4 Billion in contributions by investors. Today it is estimated closer to $1.8 Billion in total funding and is currently valued at approx. $2 Billion.

This partnership will be the key to regaining the market as the top competitor. Avant has 800,000 users on their platform currently, only SoFi has them beat with 900,000 users.

## Recommendations

* Avant should have broader selection or ranges of domains not just personal loans and credit cards. Avant has a great platform to evaluate FICO scores and utilities while considering loaning. As Avant does not have other domains to work with, they are only exposed to less than 6% of the total debt market. If Avant could use their current business partnerships to give customers with mortgage facility, auto and retail lines of credit domains they could gain profits for their stakeholders by creating more daily users and increase total loan amounts. Also credit limitations of >$35,000 should be fixed, mortgage facility would require more seed funding or funding from big banks. Avant may also build to provide online access through their platform for larger billing such as mortgages, autos and retailers. They statement could be: *“ Still low costs to borrow money; Dream of your house and car, this time will be true!”
